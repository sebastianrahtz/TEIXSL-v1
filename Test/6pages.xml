<head>MARLEY'S GHOST</head>

<p>Marley was dead: to begin with.  There is no doubt whatever
about that.  The register of his burial was signed by the
clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. 
Scrooge signed it.  And Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change,
for anything he chose to put his hand to.  Old Marley was as
dead as a door-nail.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Mind!  I don't mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge,
what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have
been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest
piece of ironmongery in the trade.  But the wisdom of our
ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed <pb n="2"/> hands
shall not disturb it, or the Country's done for.  You will
therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as
dead as a door-nail.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Scrooge knew he was dead?  Of course he did.  How could it be
otherwise?  Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many
years.  Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole
assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. 
And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but
that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the
funeral, and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I
started from.  There is no doubt that Marley was dead.  This must be
distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am
going to relate.  If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's
Father died before the play began, there would be nothing more
remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon
his own ramparts, than there  <pb n="3"/> would be in any other
middle-aged gentleman rashly  turning out after dark in a breezy spot
— say Saint  Paul's Churchyard for instance — literally to
astonish his son's weak mind.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name.  There it stood,
years afterwards, above the ware-house door: Scrooge and Marley.  The
firm was known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the
business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered
to both names.  It was all the same to him.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Oh!  But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge!  a
squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old
sinner!  Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck
out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an
oyster.  The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed
nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his
thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice.  A frosty
rime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He <pb n="4"/>
 carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced
his office in the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at
Christmas.
